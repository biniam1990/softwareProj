This is the same project as 
ArchAnFX, with Address and Quantity rules
implemented, and inline
comments about implementing
Payment rules (in CheckoutUIControl).

To make rule-checking possible, 
Jess rules have been added in a folder "business.rulefiles",
at the top level of src directory.
Referencing this rules folder inside
the ShippingBillingWindow "checkout" handler 
is not done in
a production-friendly way (the path explicitly
refers to the src folder, which won't be present in
the production version).

Also, for rules, AddressBean and RuleException have
been added to the business package.

In the real project, the Address class will be replaced
by an implemented Address interface obtained from
the Customer Subsystem, and this is what will be 
inserted into the AddressBean.

JAR FILES: These external jars have been added:
 - jess.jar
 - rulesengine.jar
 - rulesencoding.jar
